# ðŸ§¾ OCR Image Text Extraction with Tesseract
This project demonstrates how to extract text from an image using the Tesseract OCR engine and Python. It uses the pytesseract wrapper along with the Pillow library for image handling.

ðŸ”§ Requirements & Installation

Install the required packages:

!sudo apt install tesseract-ocr     # Installs Tesseract OCR engine
!pip install pytesseract            # Python wrapper for Tesseract
!pip install Pillow==9.0.0          # For image file handling

# ðŸ§  How It Works
The image is opened using the Pillow library.

Tesseract OCR (pytesseract) is used to recognize and extract text from the image.

The extracted text is printed to the console.

# ðŸ“‚ Input
Make sure to place your target image (e.g., test.png) in the correct path, or update the file path accordingly.
